Project Overview
This project focuses on building predictive models using various machine learning algorithms, particularly XGBoost, to address class imbalance in the dataset. By implementing oversampling techniques, we aim to enhance model performance and ensure a balanced representation of different classes.

Significance
The project is significant as it addresses the common challenge of class imbalance in predictive modeling. By applying techniques such as Random Oversampling and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), we enhance the model's ability to generalize, leading to better predictions and insights.

Requirements
To run this project, the following Python libraries are required:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
imbalanced-learn
xgboost
matplotlib (for visualization)
seaborn (for enhanced visualization)
statsmodels (for statistical tests)
You can install the required libraries using:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn imbalanced-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn statsmodels
Data Cleaning and Preparation
Data cleaning is crucial for ensuring the quality and integrity of the dataset. We performed the following measures:

Handling missing values.
Removing duplicates.
Normalizing data formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is conducted to gain insights into the dataset. We visualize distributions, correlations, and trends to understand the data better, which aids in feature selection and model development.

Insights from EDA:
Identification of significant features impacting the target variable.
Visualization of class distribution to highlight imbalance.
Modeling
Data Splitting
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance effectively. The train_test_split function from scikit-learn is used, ensuring stratification to maintain class distribution.

Function Definitions
We defined functions for model evaluation metrics, including accuracy and confusion matrices, to facilitate comparison between different models.

Model Implementations
Various machine learning models were implemented, including:

Logistic Regression (L1 and L2 Regularization)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Trees
Random Forest
XGBoost
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Oversampling Techniques
To handle class imbalance, both Random Oversampling and SMOTE techniques were applied. These methods increase the representation of the minority class in the training data, improving model performance.

Cross-Validation
Stratified K-Fold Cross-Validation was employed to ensure robust model evaluation by splitting the dataset into stratified folds, maintaining class distribution across training and validation sets.

Hyperparameter Tuning
Hyperparameter tuning for the XGBoost model was conducted using Randomized Search CV to find optimal model parameters, enhancing the model's predictive performance.

Results
The results indicated that the XGBoost model with Stratified K-Fold and SMOTE oversampling yielded the best performance metrics:

Accuracy: 0.9993
ROC AUC Score: 0.9792
Optimal Threshold: 0.0186
These metrics illustrate the model's effectiveness in predicting the target variable.

Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in addressing class imbalance through oversampling and hyperparameter tuning. The findings emphasize the importance of model selection and evaluation strategies in predictive analytics.
